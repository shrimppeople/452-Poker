To run project you will need to have to download Node.js and have to installed it. Once you install it or if you already
have it you navigate to the folders location through the CMD. Once you are at the file location tpye "node Poker.js" 
after that go to any browser and type in the URL "localhost:3000" and this will run the gaem for you. When playing you
will need 2 tabs one for each player, and you will play each one at a time, and choose one of them to win.
